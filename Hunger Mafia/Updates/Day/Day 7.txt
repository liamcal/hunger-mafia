Day 7

Pleased that they had managed to survive the night with no further deaths, with renewed hope the 15 remaining Tributes began discussing who they would lynch today. They decided to focus their attention on those that had so far remained quiet, interrogating those that had failed to contribute to uncovering the Careers. Throughout the day, Caitlin Bell, Maddie Mackey and Maddie Wagner all came under suspicion, but in the end the town came to a consensus. Based on her previous voting actions.

"I'm innocent! Please don't lynch me" begged Maddie. "You're making a terrible mistake!"

But the town had heard all of this before. They didn't enjoy it, but they were used to it by now. As they had done many times now, the mob encircled her, ignoring her pleas of innocence, as they did wat they believed needed to be done...

As they stepped back, they realised that they had indeed made yet another terrible mistake...

	Maddie Wagner was a regular Tribute.
