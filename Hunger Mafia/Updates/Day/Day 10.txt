DAY 10 ENDS

It was a long and stressful day for the remaining contestants. They were down to only 6, and no one was sure who among them were still siding with the Career pack. 
Over the course of the day, the survivors spent their time desperately going over previous events, trying to narrow it down and uncover the killers among them. 

As the day drew to a close, suspicions were divided between two Tributes, Evan and Maddie. Concerns were voiced regarding both of them, but when push came to shove and the sun slowly began to set, a consensus couldn't be reached. The votes were evenly split, 3-3 each for Evan and Maddie. As thunder rumbled in the distance, the town knew what they needed to do, for it was becomming all too familiar to them.

One by one they cast their votes in the re-tally. However, no one had been prepared to alter their vote, as the count remained tied.

By now the dark clouds were closing in on those that remained. Realising it would be too dangerous to stick around any longer in an attempt to come to a decision, as one they decided to forego lynching tonight, and the Tributes scattered into the darkness.
