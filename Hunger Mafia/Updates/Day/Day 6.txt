Today was a much slower day for the remaining Tributes. Their numbers had dwindled to the point where despair and desperation were starting to kick in. What had started out as a plan to survive the games unharmed had led to already more than 10 casualties with no end in sight. The Tributes were somewhat unsure of what they should do next.

Breaking the silence, one brave Tribute, Shea, spoke up and announced his suspicion of Evan. While many of the Tributes could agree with some of Shea's points, in turn they thought that his actions had been questionable as well. The debate continued gradually throughout the course of the day, with many of the Tributes hesitant to make a decision. As night approached, they knew that it would be time to decide soon. Many remained on the fence, but at the last moment, Maddie's innocence also came into question.

As the sun dissappeared beyond the horizon, the votes were tied for 2 each between Shea and Maddie. Rapidly, dark looking clouds began to cover the arena, and thunder could be heard rumbling in the distance. Knowing that they really should resolve this tie, the Tributes decided to hold an anonymous revote. One by one the Tributes wrote down the name of either Maddie or Shea on a scrap of paper to cast their vote. Once they could delay no longer, the group began to read the votes tally the votes.


@Shea Bunge: 6 (Andrew Titmuss, Caitlin Bell, Evan Kohilas, Lauren Heading, Maddie Wagner, Maxwell Hajncl)
@Maddie Wagner: 5 (Alex Rowell, Michael Cui, Mitchell Busby, Riley Hoolahan, Shea Bunge)

By a single vote, Shea's fate had been decided. Somewhat relucatantly, the mob set upon him.

@Shea Bunge was a regular Tribute.
