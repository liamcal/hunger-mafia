"I have important information!" Exclaimed Joel. "I own a handy-dandy Telscope, and using it's amazing powers, I have deduced that Rachel is a murderous Career!"

Clearly, Joel didn't believe in wasting any time...

The other Tributes weren't entirely convinced, least of all Rachel.

"What if your Telescope is brokenâ€½" Rachel queried. "I mean. It's not a particularly nice telescope. Look it's all dirty and worn. Who knows what crazy things you could be seeing..."

"Don't you be insulting my Telescope! It's a fantastic Telescope. Those dents and stuff, that just adds character." Joel clutched the Telscope defensively to his chest, a hurt expression on his face.

"Look it's nothing personal, I'm sure it means well. But the thing is wrong, I'm a good guy!" Insisted Rachel. "What about Aretha? She's been quiet. That's suspicious, we should lynch her instead!"

Some of the other Tributes thought this was a fair enough idea. But most of them weren't convinced. 

"I want to have faith in the Telescope." stated one Tribute. 

"#trustintelescope" cried another.

"If we lynch her, we can then see if this Telescope is really all it's cracked up to be" a third one proclaimed. 

With that, the mob had made up their mind. As one, they turned on Rachel. Rachel's desperation was increasinly rapdily.

"No trust me guys! You're making a big mistake! I'M NOT CRINKLY!!! I'M... NOT.... CRINCHKR!!!!!"

As the crowd set upon her though, an unmistakable crackling sound filled the air, punctuated by the sound of a canon.

@Rachel Alger was a Career.
