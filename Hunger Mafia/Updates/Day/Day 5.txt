END DAY 5

"I have a hunch!" Announced Michael. "Let's lynch Ben!"

"I have a hunch!" Announced Ben. "Let's lynch Michael!"

Unfortunately for Ben, his proclamation was not met with much enthusiasm from the rest of the Tributes.

"Uh guys. It was just a joke ok... I'm a good guy! Trust me. I wouldn't hurt a fly!"

"That' doesn't appear to be what happened last night!" replied a Tribute from the mob. "Look, you've still got blood on your hands. If you were a good guy, you wouldn't have killed Lauren."

"She was shifty okâ€½ Someone needs to take the initiative to remove the rest of the Careers before they kill us innocent ones..." Responded Ben. The Tributes remained unconvinced however, and one at a time they voiced their agreement that Ben should be the next to go. No matter how he tried to persuade them, the mob was unwavering in their conviction of his guilt.

At least, they were until the sun began to set. At this point, doubt began to cast a shadow on them all. 

"This has been too easy..." somebody muttered anxiously. "If Ben was a Career, surely the others would have tried to defend him by now..." This was enough to give some of the Tributes pause, and a few even took back their decision. However, as darkness approached, they knew they needed to act. With no better solution apparent to them, they set upon Ben anyway.

As the mov stepped back and admired their handywork, a canon fired and they released they had indeed, made a mistake...

Ben Myers was a regular Tribute
