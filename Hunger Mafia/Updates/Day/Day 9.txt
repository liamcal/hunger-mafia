Things were getting rough for the Tributes. Over half of them had been killed so far, and it had been almost a week since they knew for sure that they had eliminated one of the Careers. Worst of all, it seemed like the last few days had been in vain, for they were still unsure of who they should lynch.

The day ticked on and a few names were thrown about here and there. Many were hesitant to vote, right up until the end of the day. As the last of the daylight started to slip away, eventually the town had narrowed it down to Evan and Michael, but they were unable to come to a decision.

As thunder rumbled in the distance, the town knew they would have to resort to a silent vote once more. As they took it in turns writing down a name, they desperately hoped that they had made the right choice. As another clap of thunder rang out, it was clear they didn't have time to wait for the remaining Tributes to cast their votes. A sense of urgency among them, they hastily counted the votes:

Michael Cui: 7 (Alex Rowell, Andrew Titmuss, Caitlin Bell, Evan Kohilas, Maddie Mackey, Mitchell Busby)
Evan Kohilas: 2 (Michael Cui, David Vo)

After coming to an almost unanimous decision, the town did what they had gotten so well at doing lately, applying their lynching devices to Michael.

	Michael Cui was a regular Tribute!

While they had been busy voting, the Tributes had fialed to notice a table with a large stash of items, both new and old, being set up nearby. Now was their last chance to decide if they wished to visit the feast.
