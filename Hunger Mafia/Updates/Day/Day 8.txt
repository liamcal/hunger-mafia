DAY 8 ENDS

With the loss of Riley and no further information to go on, the Tribute's were well and truly stumped. They were unsure how to proceed. They knew that they really needed to start eliminating some of those Careers, and that every innocent life lost was a big deal. 

They spent the day deliberating but were unable to come to a decision. Some believed they should continue to go after those that had remained in the shadows, while others thought that those with a known history of violence should be removed.

At the very last minute as clouds begin to cover the arena and the last rays of sunlight dippped below the horizon, the town came to an agreement that Maxwell would be the next to go.

Maxwell Hajncl was a regular Tribute.


Dismayed, the Tributes prepared for the night to come.
However, by now, after spending a week in the arena, fatigue was starting to set in. Everyone was feeling weaker, and they new that their capacity to successfully avoid and defend attacks would be limited.
