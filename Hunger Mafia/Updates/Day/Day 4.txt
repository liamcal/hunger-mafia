END DAY 4

The Tributes gathered back in the clearing near where the Games had begun, as they began to discuss on who they would lynch today. They had been fortunate so far in eliminating a handful of the Careers, and had started to collect bits and pieces of information. Regardless, as the day progressed, they had difficulty piecing it all together. It was hard to interpret the actions and motives of the previously fallen Tributes, and throughout the course of the day many names were suggested. 

At various points, the spotlight fell upon Riley Hoolahan, Lauren Heading and Ben Myers in turn, before settling on Robbie Collins at the last moment. While his antics had been amusing so far, the remaining Tributes couldn't justify his previous logic. As one, the mob set upon the Tribute from District 9 with the glorious beard.

Robbie Collins was a regular Tribute.
