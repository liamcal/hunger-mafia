After mistakenly killing yet another innocent Tribute, the remaining living players somberly slunk off into the night, hoping they would live to see another day.

In their various hiding spots around the arena, the Tributes waited...

...and waited...

...and waited... When suddenly their waiting was interrupted by the sound of a massive explosion! This explosion was unlike the canon that was becomming all too familiar to them all, it was much louder, causing the arena to shake beneath them. As the Tributes' ears stopped ringing, they braced themselves for the canon shots to signal the casualties...

...yet it never came. In fact, as the sun finally rose once more and the Tributes gathered, they were relieved to see that everybody had survived the night. Of course, that meant that there was still a number of Career's hiding among them.
