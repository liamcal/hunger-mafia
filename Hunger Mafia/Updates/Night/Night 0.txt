As the Tributes braced themselves for what was to come, a golden number 10 appeared above them all, and begin counting down. If they hadn't formulated a plan yet, now was the time for each Tribute to decide if they would run the risk of gaining a valuable item, or if they would rather retreat into the forest.
As the timer reached zero, a loud tone echoed throughout the enclosure, indicating the start of the 42nd annual Hunger Games! 

At once the Tributes dashed off in their chosen locations. A large number of them headed straight for the Cornucopia, while a handful ran in the opposite direction, getting as far away from the bloodshed as possible. Within moments, every single item had been snatched up. Those Tributes that had been successful made a dash for cover, determined not to stick around any longer than they needed too. It wasn't long before the others that had missed out realised that there was nothing else for them to claim, and most of them began to back off as well. 
Amidst the chaos and confusion, a number of fights broke out amongst the Tributes. As the dust settled, Quinn Roberts' body was found lying on the ground. In the distance a canon fired, signalling the first casualty of the Games. 
	Quinn Roberts was a regular Tribute.

Some time later, the Tributes nervously began to gather in the open field once more as they had planned. By now, each of them had concealed any items they may be carrying, and it was impossible to tell exactly who had killed Quinn. Regardless, it was apparent that the Tributes would not be able to escape the Games with no further casualties. The Careers were among them, with a thirst for death and glory. As previously discussed, they begin the task of deciding on which among them they would lynch today, in the hope of ridding themselves of the Careers before they were wiped out instead.
