Night fell once more, and the Tributes began to prepare for the battles to come. Those that remained had given up on a peaceful resolution to the combat. After everything they had gone through, many believed that now it was time to act, to take matters into their own hands. 

Which sounded great in theory. In reality, most of the night was spent with the Tributes frantically searching out one another, while somehow managing to completely avoid crossing paths. One of the Tributes had opted for a slightly different tactic. After chugging down a sparkling red liquid, they pulled a small circular device out of his pocket, and lobbed it off into the distance. Bracing for what was to come, they took cover as yet another explosion shook the arena. Once the smoke had cleared, the Tribute peeked up over the bank, but was frustrated to see that their target had just managed to dodge the attack and was now escaping off into the distance.

Exasperate, the Tribute stood back up and readied themselves to find shelter for the rest of the night. As they turned around however, they found themselves face to face with another Tribute, weapon raised with a murderous glint in their eye. The Tribute braced themselves for the attack, hoping that the leather armour they were wearing would be tough enough. The attacker charged forward, making up for what they lacked in swiftness with momentum and brute strength. Raising a weapon, the Tribute did their best to block the attack, but the sheer force of the strike sent them sprawling to the ground. The attacker stood over their victim, weapon raised to finish the job. As he plunged the weapon down, a cannon shot rang out, signalling the death of Alex Rowell.

	Alex Rowell was a regular Tribute.
