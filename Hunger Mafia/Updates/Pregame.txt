As the citizens of the Capitol prepare for their annual Hunger Games viewing parties, the 28 selected Tributes huddle together in their accommodations, silently contemplating what is to come. Gradually they begin to converse, discussing the tyranny of the Capitol and the effect that the Games have had on the district. Together, the 28 Tributes resolve to do what they can to subvert the Gamemakers and take a stand in their own display of rebellion. They begin to hatch a plan, wherein which they will refuse to kill each other until the Gamemakers release every single one of them.
Yet not all the Tributes are so keen on this plan. One, a Career, trained to fight in the Games since their birth, is keen for the bloodshed to take its natural course. Subtly, they begin recruiting others within the group to join the cause. These Careers plan to secretly begin killing their fellow Tributes one by one, until only they are left standing.
It isn’t long before the other Tributes catch wind of the plot. Being unsure of the perpetrators identities, they agree to debate one another’s innocent and hold a vote on one player to kill per day. With any luck, the Careers may be eradicated, and the remaining survivors may claim victory together. 
Of course, with the readily available weapons littered around the arena, it is entirely possible that anyone could take matters into their own hands at any point.

Welcome, to the Hunger Games!
